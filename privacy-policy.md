# Privacy Policy

This Chrome extension respects your privacy.

## Data Collection
The extension collects authentication information in the form of a GitHub OAuth access token. This token is used solely to authenticate the user with GitHub in order to push Codewars solutions to the user's own GitHub repository.

The extension also reads website content from Codewars pages to extract user-written solution code when the user explicitly initiates the action.

## Data Usage
Collected data is used only for the core functionality of the extension and is never sold, shared, or transferred to third parties, except as required to communicate with GitHub's API as part of the user-requested functionality.

## Data Storage
Authentication tokens and user preferences are stored locally in the user's browser using Chrome's storage APIs.

## Data Security
No data is transmitted to any external server owned by the developer. All communication occurs directly between the user's browser and GitHub's official API.

## User Control
Users may revoke GitHub access at any time through their GitHub account settings.

## Changes
This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes.

## Contact
If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact the developer via the GitHub repository.
